# Wine Quality

Wine has been around for a really long time, almost about 5,000 BC. Have we ever thought why it's been around for so long. Because of it is easy to make process of simply yeast eating the natural fermentable sugars in grape juice to give its main product alcohol. Any fruit juice with fermentable sugars can make wine but grapes being higher on the fruit evolutionary ladder on fermentable sugar content we choose grapes for making wine.

Wine market is huge in US. Accroding to the statistical atudy, the wine sale for this year is estimated to be 39.8 billion dollars in US and 60 billion dollars around the globe. With these huge cashflowing business, companies are always willing to use technologies to leviate their business to next level and to think about what is next. With the remarkable power of Data Science, Machine Learning and Analytics, the company can make use of their data to stay ahead of their competition. It helps the exective, directors, mangers to understand their business and change statergy, make decision using a data driven approach.

# About the Dataset

Wine Quality dataset is public available for research in the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning repository created by Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) in 2009. This repository has two datasets of red and white wine samples which consists of inputs includes objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

# Analysis and Prediction

Below are the list of works that have been as a part fo this project

- Finding out and visualizing  Missing values
- Distribution check of the wine quality
- Relationship between Wine Quality and Alcohol content in the wine
- Correlation between predictors and between the predictors and target variables
- Removing the Skewness in the predictors for better model predicttion
- Outliers Detection
- Buliding Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks model for the classify the wine quality and also the type of wine
